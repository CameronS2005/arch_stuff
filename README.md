# arch_stuff
A collection of my arch linux scripts (I am very new to arch so its nothing to impressive just a personal archive)

Testbench: Dell Chromebook 3100, MFG YR: 2021

Arch Version: 2023.08.01, Kernel: 6.4.7

# -------------------------------- #

BE CAREFUL WITH THESE SCRIPTS AS THEY COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR DRIVES IF NOT CONFIGURED PROPERLEY!

to use on a fresh copy of the archiso, simply modify the variables in the config of the script, and run "curl -s setup.sh -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CameronS2005/arch_stuff/main/setup.sh; chmod +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh" and follow the directions!
